# Deploy Hoppscotch

[Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.com/) is an open-source API development ecosystem that helps you create and test your API requests saving precious time in development.

This article will show you how to deploy Hoppscotch with PostgreSQL on Zeabur.

## Method 1: Deploy from Template

### Step 1: Deploy the Template

Click the button below to deploy the template to Zeabur.

[![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates/HIB6B9)

### Step 2: Create a Database

After you've deployed the template, Zeabur will create a project with PostgreSQL and Hoppscotch services for you.

In order for the Hoppscotch service to run properly, you need to create a database named `hoppscotch` in the PostgreSQL database first.

In your PostgreSQL service, you can find a tab named **Database**, where you can manage your databases with one click.

### Step 3: Restart Hoppscotch Service

You need to restart the Hoppscotch service to let it get the correct database connection information.

## Method 2: Deploy from Scratch

### Step 1: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Go to the [Projects](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, you will see all your projects, and the "Create Project" button is at the end of all projects.

### Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

Hoppscotch will store your data in a PostgreSQL database, so you need to create a PostgreSQL database first so that Hopscotch service can be started.
Click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", you will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, Zeabur will automatically start deploying your PostgreSQL service.

### Step 3: Create a Database

In order for the Hoppscotch service to run properly, we need to create a database named `hoppscotch` in the PostgreSQL database first.

Usaully, you need a PostgreSQL client to connect to the PostgreSQL service and create a database. But Zeabur provides a convenient way to create a database.

In your PostgreSQL service, you can find a tab named **Database**, where you can manage your databases with one click.

**Hoppscotch** requires a database named `hoppscotch`, so we need to create a database named `hoppscotch`.
Type `hoppscotch` in the input box and click the **Create** button, then Zeabur will create the database for you.

### Step 4: Deploy Hoppscotch Service

Once you have successfully create a PostgreSQL service and setup the database, you can start deploying `Hoppscotch` now.
In the Zeabur console, click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", you will find Hoppscotch in the list.

        <Callout>
          If you deploy Hoppscotch first without deploying PostgreSQL, then you need to restart
  the Hoppscotch service after deploying the PostgreSQL service to let it get the
  correct database connection information.
          </Callout>

## Setup Hoppscotch 

### Bind a domain for each port

In the "Domain" block of the Hoppscotch service in the Zeabur dashboard, you can bind domains for each port of the service.
This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

As you can see, there are three ports exposed by the Hoppscotch service.

![Deploy Hoppscotch](/marketplace/hoppscotch/domain-ports.png)

- Frontend Port: The port for the Hoppscotch frontend, which is used to access the Hoppscotch web page.

- Backend Port: The port for the Hoppscotch backend, which is used to access the Hoppscotch API.

- Admin Port: The port for the Hoppscotch admin panel, which is used to access the Hoppscotch admin panel.

You can bind a domain for each port by selecting in the dropdown list.

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).

### Start using Hoppscotch

After the deployment is complete and domains created, you can access your Hoppscotch service.
